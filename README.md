# Portfolio projects

In here, I choose to upload bioinformatics projects that I have sat down to compute and hopefully this kind of data will be useful to users who find it.

Python is quite useful in bioinformatic data analysis and so I compile most of the data in Jupyter Notebook. Whatever is not python, most likely ran from the Terminal directly

`Note` Definitely more projects to come
